/**
 *  **TBD:**
 *  Implement a function that returns all the top level readable elements on the page, keeping in mind the ignore list.
 *  Start Parsing inside the body element of the HTMLPage.
 *  A top level readable element is defined as follows:
 *      1. The text node contained in the element should not be empty
 *      2. The element should not be in the ignore list (also referred as the block list)
 *      3. The element should not be a child of another element that has only one child.
 *            For example: <div><blockquote>Some text here</blockquote></div>. div is the top level readable element and not blockquote
 *      4. A top level readable element should not contain another top level readable element.
 *            For example: Consider the following HTML document:
 *            <body>
 *              <div id="root"></div>
 *              <div id="content-1">
 *                <article>
 *                  <header>
 *                    <h1 id="title">An Interesting HTML Document</h1>
 *                    <span>
 *                      <address id="test">John Doe</address>
 *                    </span>
 *                  </header>
 *                  <section></section>
 *                </article>
 *              </div>
 *            </body>;
 *            In this case, #content-1 should not be considered as a top level readable element.
